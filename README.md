 Task 5 - Network Traffic Capture and Analysis

 Tools Used
- *Wireshark* on Kali Linux (inside Oracle VirtualBox)

Task Description
Captured and analyzed network traffic using Wireshark. Identified four key network protocols from the captured packets and saved the capture as a .pcap file.

 Protocols Identified

1. ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
   - Used for diagnostic tools like ping
   - Example: Packet exchange with IP 142.250.77.110 (Google)

2. DNS (Domain Name System)
   - Resolves domain names to IP addresses
   - Example: Query for openai.com

3. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
   - Ensures reliable delivery of data between devices
   - Seen in connections to port 443 (HTTPS)

4. TLS (Transport Layer Security)
   - Provides encryption over TCP (used in HTTPS)
   - Detected in secure communication to websites

 Files
- task5_capture.pcap: The packet capture file containing the analyzed traffic.
  and i added some screenshot of analysed network and identified protocls.

  Github upload
i created new github repository and i tried git push method to upload my task5 to github but i failed 
to do that so i used shared folder method .by using this method i shared the task5 folder to my window host and then i uploaded to the git hub reposityory.
